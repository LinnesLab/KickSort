# KickSort
Arduino library for different sorting algorithms including quicksort, bubble sort, insertion sort, shell sort, and comb sort.
The class is templated allowing for ease of use across different data types. This library is built from aggregating and
modifying different sorting implementations from various other GitHub users including: robtillaart, emilv, luisllamasbinaburo, and dndubins. Thanks!
